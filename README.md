WordPress plugin to view mobile websites or webapps in your blog
Some time ago I started to develop mobile web applications with jQuery mobile, Bootstrap, etc. After a while I thought that I would like to show these apps on my WordPress blog in a post or a page. Not every user knows how to use the developer tools of modern browsers.
I decided to develop a WordPress plugin which is able to show these apps in an iframe element which is wrapped inside a div container that holds an image of the mobile device of you choice.
